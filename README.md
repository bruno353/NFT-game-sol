# NFT Game Project
The goal of our game is to destroy the dragon. You will choose between a warrior (He-man), a shooter(Bkswaw) or a wizard(Skeletor) NFT to battle the boss.  Players can order their **character NFT** to attack the boss and deal damage to it. 

Players need to work together to attack the boss and bring its HP down to 0. Every time a player hit the boss, the boss hits the player back! If the NFT's HP goes below 0, the player's NFT **dies** and they can't hit the boss anymore. Players **can only have one character NFT in their wallet.** Once the character's NFT dies, it's game over.
